    <h3>----A good paper work I made from high school----</h3>
    <p>
        When a hard drive of a computer is formatted, everything is deleted and it becomes empty, a sign for a new start, and how it functions depends on the things that the owner puts in. Just like how a computer starts new when it’s formatted, when a person moves to a new country, they begin a new life, they have to set up their own “program” that helps support their life. Or at least it’s true for me, when I came to the United States of America, my life turned a new page, I formatted myself and began a new life. But better than a computer, my culture came along with me, it helped me a lot by making my “program”.

    <br>
    <p>
        Going to a new country, the first conflict I think that every single person needs to go through is to rip their past from themselves and accept the present, or “set the new program to your computer of life”. I’m not an exception, when I lived in Vietnam my family wasn’t very wealthy, but we had enough for me to not worry about whether or not we would get to eat the next day (I had what I needed, I didn’t cry for toys like a child, but I can afford to have what’s needed, for example like studying). As a book, my life turned to a new chapter when I got a report from grandfather saying he wanted to bring me and my family to America. At first, it was quite unacceptable when you already have everything (or most) then go back to having nothing, also it was a surprise for me, my life was perfect in Vietnam. Now what do I have to do? I have to start everything over from the smallest things (I went back to bring a freshmen even though I was a senior in Vietnam, my location changed) to the biggest things (I changed my way of studying, way of communicating, also I worried a lot about my family and how they were going to adapt to this new environment), so for a short time, I was really shocked about this new environment. But later nowadays, I think I’m pretty lucky that I got to move here, I see my life getting better, even though there’s still  some disadvantages stuck in my family, but for me, I don’t have to be worried about my future, by “resetting” my schoolwork and “restarting” high school I’ve gained a lot of skills to support me in my dreams, and a lot of things that help me change to have a better life in the future. Back to the time when I just moved to America, when I was still shocked about my life having changed so much, fortunately my family was there by my side, it helped me felt better about what I had , and they left me a place, so I could stand up, and begin my new life again.

        Additionally, on the other side of the face of the earth I still have someone who I think of as family, that person is..my girlfriend. The relationship between me and her is the only thing that I carried on to this new world. And again, when I first came to this country, she was like the “programmer” that helped set up my “computer” of life, she helped me acquire a new and positive perspective in living in a new country. There’s a fact that living in the US can give me an opportunity to higher and better education, and based on this, I can have a better life. She’s the one that helped point out that advantage to living in a new world. At the same time, she encouraged me when a hard time in this country had me stuck, this reminds me of the first time I studied English, even though I learned it before in my country, it was taught really differently in the US, and I got stuck a lot in recognizing which is which, all the while she stood by me, and helped me by telling me what my mistakes were (she’s better than me in English), I think I’m lucky that I have her as my girlfriend, even though we are seperated by sea (and also the time zone having a 12 hour difference between Minnesota and Vietnam). By having a long distance relationship a lot of people have told me to break up with her before, even my friends. They would say stuff like she might be doing something I don’t know about and when I eventually find out about it I’ll get hurt but I don’t think so, we’re both loyal and faithfaul to each other and I believe in this strong bond that binds us together. We hung out for a long time and there’s no reason she needs to hide anything from me. She’s an important part of my life, without her I wouldn’t be as well off as I am today and I appreciate her for all she’s done.

        Back to my own story, when somebody has a new life, the first essential thing to living is a source of income, my family isn’t an exception. This problem was solved though when my grandpa helped my family find a job, that helped us prospered enough to live, afford a house, two cars and have no worries about debt, and how this culture affects to my life? That is about all the things I just have pointed out. Because of the debt that my family have to pay is large enough that cause a little change with what my family had in Vietnam. In my country, my dad is the source of income for the whole family, and this means that we don’t have to worry about the money, his income is more than enough for my family to live, and now , my mother have to go to work, and as I told she didn’t work before, and this cause a change for her life also, at first she’s quite hard to accept the job, she often get some ache after she went home, and this cause a lot of struggle. Then to help my family, finding a job is my though at that time, so it’s not hard to reach something when you set as a goal and you really want to have it. So I have a job, and not a lot time after, my family exactly went better, my salary is not made a big affective to everything that the conflicts my family have, but at least base on it, I could own something that I need to, by my own strength. But later, I had to quit my job, my parents didn’t want me to work anymore, they were afraid that working prevent my rate of studying, even I can keep that rate stay “constant”.Actually  thing they were worried about is my health, and that’s true, when I had my job, my health is going down. Thus, I have to quit my work, as they ordered.  Not because of no having job, life between having a something to do and without it is not having a big change for it, I can have what I want, because my parents help me to get it, even I don’t ask for it, I can. But later in my life, I need to find something to work again, because my life in college is not easy, and have something to do, make my family get a bit easy to breath on this time.

        The place I live in is Minnesota, like I said before, or typically is in Saint Paul, Twin cities, on this place, the first advantage that I have in this state, this city is: There is a social service that call Vietnam social service (VSS), this service is very useful for the families that have just come to the US, this service help us to find a job, give us a lot benefit in finding somewhere to live, to have a good and cheap clinic, to help us on tax returning,… My family gets a better live in here also base on this service. Another things that help my family a lot is : this state have a higher opportunity to have a job,  a cheaper insurance that have good service, and the money that have to pay on a house is cheaper than a lot of states that I have known from hearing my friend, my cousin that live in US, on another state. With these advantage, again “my family is getting a lot easier to live”. And at last this state can help me on my future, in this state, locate a place that got a third place on teaching pharmacy in the US, the UoM (University of Minnesota), also, there is an open gate to hire a pharmacist (high chance for pharmacist to have a job). To be a pharmacist is the destination I want to reach on the future, “it’s not hard to reach something when you set as a goal and you really want to have it”, so I’m confident that I will be pharmacist someday, in that day, I won’t have to worry to find a job, because I live in Minnesota.

        Nobody is perfect, and trying hard to cover the bad characteristics and enhance the characteristics that are good at make people become better in life. Either do I, I contain myself a lot of disability that I have to get better on, and a lot of ability that I can take an advance at. One of my disability is my language, English. Live in US, I have to study how to live in  US’s way, that’s the ideas you want to show must be by English, and learn English help me get me closer to it. Now my vocab is not enough for doing what I want, so I have to try hard to be as other people, also other students in school this time.Even sometime it’s quite funny when things I try to show is getting a wrong meaning, pronoucing a word for an example, of course I feel hesitate about it, but  “everybody become much better base on learn from their mistake”, and I get better from my funny experiment. English is my bad skill, but Mathematic is the great thing that I can take an advance on it. For me, deal with number seems like easier than deal with words, but base on these numbers, I can make a better deal with words, I can “cover my bad skill and enhance my good skill” at the same time, because I can talk to my teacher about my math problem, or writing a tutor for the math skill I have learn, and that’s also on English, that’s why I can get better on English why I try to get somethings new about Math. That is a disability and ability on the subject that I can learn either on school or in the real life. How about others? I have a bad disadvantage that is I’m a slow learner, everything I have learn on the school come to my head are really slow that I need an extra time to get through it at home, so I have to study hard to get through this, luckily, hardworking and good on memorize are the abilities that help me to go over, and now, even though it’s not easy to prove these ability but I will try hard to show it. My disability shows me my bad, teach me the experience, and good once help me to go forward and cover things that I stuck .

        I’m a boy, and this does not effect on me so much. There is a fact in Asia, that’s boys are often live in a higher level than girls. I don’t know why my traditional have it? but that’s still true, that’s why there is the great things for me that I’m a boy. But that is in Asia for generally, and in Vietnam in particular way, where I live now is in the US, all boys and girls have treat equally, so that why this not effect so much on me. But how become a boys “does not effect on me so much” that now I am a guy of my girlfriend, and will be a husband and a father so far. My father is my idol, in Vietnam, his ability is enough to make whole family lives quite easy, make us no worry about debt, cars, jobs, and lot of things that I can think of. So become a father like him is also my goal on future, so I can be a main character for my family, my wife and my children won’t have to worry anything at all.

        The last personal culture that causes an effect on my life is my age. I have a better situation than other high school students is now I am twenty years old, and I can do a lot of things that high school student can’t. I can do a lot of thing without my parent’s permit, even sometimes I need their permit to do, but most of everything is ok without it (like having a job, joining a club,…). I can separate myself to my family and start to live alone, this may help me in future, because maybe I’ll have a school that’s far my home and it’s better to live in dorm. And sometime I can legally do things that “younger” people can’t (go to casino, having alcohol drinking, go to night club,…). Even I can do a lot of things at this age, but most of them I don’t want to do, so like my gender, it’s not effect on me so much.

        My life is it, and everything I have is it, they creat an effect on me, they change me. Since the day I came to America, what I have is an effect to my life, they helps me to make up the “real” me, make me got a better thought, and there will not a hard thing that I have if I move to somewhere new someday, because I have formatted myself once, even It’s not easy to complete it but It’s not any more hard.
